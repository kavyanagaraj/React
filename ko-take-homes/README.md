# ko-take-homes

This is a repository of take-home coding challenges used for interviews. 

The top-level folders indicate the projects for which the challenges inside pertain to, so we aren't giving out super-duper backend challenges to front-end candidates, etc.

There is also a `general` folder for challenges that aren't specific to a given product.
